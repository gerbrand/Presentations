https://github.com/gnab/remark/wiki/Presentation-mode

Copied from the Wiki:
```markdown
Presentation mode can be activated/deactivated by pressing the P key on your keyboard while having the window focused.

You will be presented with your current slide, a preview of the next slide, your current and next slide notes as well as a timer.

Additionally you can press C to create a new window where the same presentation will be displayed. This window is linked to the main window. Changing slides on one will cause the slide to change on the other.

```
