# Generate your test-data

Gerbrand van Dieijen

Amsterdam.scala Meetup, 27 Februari 2020
???
The need for writing automated tests is now well accepted. What about generating your test-data? Most of you may have heard of Property-based-testing, but do you use it? This session is for people who write unit-tests regularly and want start on property-based testing using Scalacheck.
We'll start with some classical unit tests for a sample application. First, some of the tests are replaced by TableDrivenProperty test, removing many near duplicate unit-tests. Next we'll go deeper into Scalacheck's generators, not just making arbitrary data.

# What is Property based testing

--

* Check properties about your software

  * Creating properties is what you do

--
  * You also have to write asserts, be creative on properties

--

* Framework tries to find data that fails your properties
  * You might have to create generators yourself
* *Shrinking* to find smallest counter-example
???

What does my software actually do? What is supposed to do?
Not very different from TDD, or automatic tests in general but slightly more fundamental
Framework tries to find data that will fail your test.
Data could be random, or based on some corpus.

What are properties ?

# History
- 1999: QuickCheck, by by John Hughes and Koen Claessen

--
- 2007: ScalaCheck, by Rickard Nilsson

--
- Implementations for other programming languages, including: C++, PHP, Python, Java

???
So including imperative languages also

# What is Property Based Testing Not

--

* Proving correctness

--
  * Type-checking, dependent types, refinement types
  * Idris, Coq

--
* Testing pure functions only

--
  * Also for integration-tests too
  * But no global side-effects (or rollback after each test)

???
https://hypothesis.works/articles/referential-transparency/

* Also for integration-tests too
* Referential transparency is not a must
  * But it helps
  * But no global side-effects (or rollback after each test)

* For Example, Property based testing is used to test software of Volvo (from John Hughes)
    being supplied by suppliers

For proving certain properties you could types

# How to get started?

--
- Most basic Property: does my software crash?
- Generate for your input
- Asserts in your code

--
- *Fuzzing*

???
Audience question? What is most basic property you can think of yourr software?


* Very much related to property based testing
* Slightly less academic origin
* Using random data originally
* Checking the property: does it crash?

---
# Existing unit tests?
- Turn examples into tables
- Try to generate input data
- Use existing asserts

# Dependencies

Add to build.sbt:
```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.scalacheck" %% "scalacheck" % "1.14.3" % Test
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatest" %% "scalatest" % "3.1.1" % Test
libraryDependencies += "org.scalatestplus" %% "scalatestplus-scalacheck" % "3.1.0.0-RC2" % Test
libraryDependencies += "eu.timepit" %% "refined-scalacheck" % refinedVersion % Test
```

---

# Add imports
```scala
import java.util.{Date, UUID}

import org.scalacheck.Gen
import org.scalatest._
import org.scalatestplus.scalacheck.ScalaCheckPropertyChecks

```

---
# Unit test
Simple unit test
```scala

case class ForeName(name: String) extends AnyVal

case class SurName(name: String) extends AnyVal
case class Name(foreName: ForeName, surName: SurName) {
    def display(): String = ...
}

class NameSpec extends WordSpecLike with Matchers {

    "Name" should {
    "should contain space between first and last name" in {
    Name(ForeName("Daan"), SurName("Vries")).display() should be ("Daan Vries")
    }
    "should be just forename" in {
    Name(ForeName("Merel")).display() should be ("Merel")
    }

}

```

---
# Simple test with table data
Test with examples
```scala
import org.scalatest.prop.TableDrivenPropertyChecks._

class CountrySpec extends WordSpecLike with Matchers {

  "CountryCode" should {

    "parse from JSON" in {
      forAll(
        Table(
          ("input", "expected"),
          ("NL", CountryCode.NL),
          ("BE", CountryCode.BE),
          ("nl", CountryCode.NL),
        )
      ) { (input, expected) =>
        {
          assert(JsString(input).as[CountryCode] === expected)
        }
      }
    }
}

```

# Simple test with random data

```scala
class MyUIDTest extends WordSpecLike with Matchers with ScalaCheckPropertyChecks {

  val counter = Gen.choose(0, Int.MaxValue >> 8)
  val date    = Gen.calendar.map(_.getTime)

  forAll(date, counter) { (d: Date, c: Int) =>
        {
          val objectId   = new ObjectId(d, c)
          val uuid = objectIdToUUID(objectId)
          uuid.value should be(UUID.fromString(uuid.value.toString))
        }
     }
   }
    ```
---
# More generators

--
* Using for expressions

```scala
  val emailGen = for {
    username <- Gen.asciiPrintableStr
    server   <- Gen.asciiPrintableStr
  } yield (Email(s"$username@$server"))

```

--
* Using map
```scala
val dateTimeGen   = Gen.calendar.map(new DateTime(_))
```

---
* Generating a domain class

```scala
val posBigDecimal = Gen.choose(0, 100000d).map(BigDecimal(_))
val percentage = Gen.choose(0, 1)
val currencyGen = Gen.oneOf(Seq(Currency.Euro, Currency.Chf))

val priceGen = for {
    withoutTax <- posBigDecimal
    vatRate    <- percentage
    withTax = withoutTax * (1 + vatRate)
} yield (Price(withoutTax, withTax, vatRate))
```

--
Using the generator to test a property
```scala
forAll(priceGen) {
case (price: Price) => {
        whenever(price.vatRate>0) { price.withoutTax should be (price.withTax -  (price.withTax * vatRate)) }
    }
}
```
Tip: use whenever often

???
Use whenever often, depending on implementation, helps framework on 'shrinking', to find specific data that fails the test

---

# Arbitrary data for any type
```scala
implicit val arbitraryEmail         = Arbitrary(emailGen)
implicit val arbitraryCurrency      = Arbitrary(currencyGen)
implicit val arbitraryDateTime      = Arbitrary(dateTimeGen)
implicit val arbitraryPriceGen      = Arbitrary(priceGen)
```

--
Using shapeless for case classes
```scala
import org.scalacheck.ScalacheckShapeless._

implicitly[Arbitrary[Name]]
```
--
Using types only for a property (notice the {

```scala
forAll { (n: Name) =>
  whenever(n.surname.name.length>0) { n.dislayName should contain (s" ${surname.name}") }
}
```
---
You use arbitrary types in Gen too
```scala
val User = for {
    name <- Gen.resultOf(Name)
    email <- emailGen
} yield (User(name, email))
```

---
# Generator libraries
- Share generator as library for your domain
- Use existing generators
  - https://github.com/47deg/scalacheck-toolbox

--
- Use existing libraries
  -
---
# Wrapping up

- Start simple
- Use generators based on existing examples
- Fuzzing where applicable
- Use specific types to allow arbitraty data
